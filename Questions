Server-side technologies
Advantages:

Handle complex processing and data securely on the server.

Can interact with databases and manage user sessions.

Enable dynamic content generation.

Disadvantages:

Require server resources and can be slower due to network latency.

More complex to develop and maintain.

Depend on server availability.

Three web scripting languages:

PHP: Widely supported, easy to learn, great for web apps, but can be less performant.

JavaScript (Node.js): Allows full-stack development with one language, fast and scalable, but callback complexity can be a challenge.

Python: Clean syntax, great for rapid development and frameworks like Django, but less common in shared hosting.

Control structures and OOP in web development

Control structures: if-else, loops, and switches control the flow of the program based on conditions or iterations.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Organizes code into objects/classes for better modularity, reuse, and maintenance; important for managing complex web apps.

Key Web-programming concepts
i. HTTP and HTTPS:

HTTP is the protocol for transferring web data; HTTPS is the secure version using encryption (SSL/TLS) to protect data privacy and integrity.

ii. Stateless programming:

Each web request is independent with no stored context; servers do not remember previous interactions unless sessions or cookies are used to maintain state.
